# Engine - JQuery Plugin

### Some Background Info:
This JQuery plugin was developed sometime during 2014-2015 (when we all loved Hashbangs in our URLs). The plugin was developed to ease front-end application development and rapid prototyping. Basically, the plugin consumes a JSON configuration file to load the specified partials into containers (kinda similar to AngularJS). It also exposes some utility methods to help with development.

> The plugin is no longer in active development and this is an early version of the plgin that I found in my archives, hence Support will be limited. It uses really old versions of dependent libraries (Jquery, bootstrap etc). Upgrading them to the latest versions might cause unexpected issues.
